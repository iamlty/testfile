I was heartened by your concern and anxiety for me, for when you heard that I intended to spend the summer on my Tuscan estate, you sought to dissuade me, believing that the region is unhealthy. It is true that the Tuscan shore extending along the coast is oppressive and noxious, but my estate lies far back from the sea; indeed, it lies below the Apennines, the most salubrious of mountains. So to help you to dispense with all fear on my account, hear my recital of the climate, the geography of the region, and the pleasant situation of my villa. These details will be a pleasure for you to hear, and for me to recount.

The climate in winter is cold and frosty, so it repels and rejects myrtles, olives, and other trees which delight in continual warmth. However, it bears with laurels and yields most handsome ones, though from time to time it kills them but not more often than happens in the neighborhood of Rome. In summer it is remarkably temperate; the air is constantly stirred by currents, but more often they are light breezes rather than winds. As a result many live to old age. You can see grandfathers and great-grandfathers of men in their prime, and you can hear old stories and talk of men of the past, so that when you go there, you think that you were born in a different era.

The appearance of the area is very beautiful. Think of some massive amphitheater, one which nature alone can fashion. The broad and expansive plain is ringed with mountains, on the topmost levels of which are glades of tall and ancient trees. A good deal of varied hunting is available there, and woodland suitable for felling descends with the mountain slopes. Between these areas of woodland are hills whose soil is rich and fertile (no outcrop of rock readily meets the eye anywhere, even if you are looking for it); they do not yield in fertility to the broadest plains. The harvests that ripen there are rich; true, they arrive rather late, but they are no smaller in size. Below them, vineyards extend on every flank, presenting an identical appearance as they interweave far and wide. At the lowest level below them plantations grow, and adjoining them are meadows and fields—fields which only strapping oxen and the strongest ploughs can break through, for when the ground is first ploughed, the soil cleaves fast, and comes out in such great clods that it is only finally subdued when turned over nine times. The meadows bloom with flowers like jewels; they nurture trefoil and other delicate plants which are always soft and fresh-looking, for they are all nourished by streams all year round. Yet where much water gathers, there is no marshland because it lies on a slope, and any water which is attracted there and fails to be absorbed pours into the Tiber.

The river cuts through the middle of the fields. It can take boats, and it conveys all the produce down to Rome, though only in winter and spring, for in summer its level lowers, and with its dry bed it abandons its reputation as a massive river until the autumn, when it claims it back. You will experience great pleasure by gazing out from the mountain over the countryside, for you will get the impression of looking not at the landscape but at some painting of a scene of extraordinary beauty. Wherever the eye settles, it will be refreshed by the variation and the pattern which is outlined.

The villa lies at the base of a hill, but the view seems to be from the top, for the hill rises so gently and gradually, and the slope is so deceptive, that you would think, not that you were mounting it, but that you had already done so. The Apennines lie in the rear, but at some distance. No matter how sunny and still the day is, the house welcomes breezes from them, but they are not piercing and excessive, but subdued, and they are played out because of the distance they travel. The house for the most part faces south, and in summer entices the sun from midday, and in winter from a little earlier, into a colonnade which is broad and correspondingly long. It contains several rooms, and also an entrance hall similar to those in days of old.

In front of the colonnade is a terrace divided into several sections of different shapes which are separated by hedges of box. From it a raised platform slopes downward, on which there are shapes of animals facing each other, fashioned from box. On the level below there is acanthus, soft and virtually transparent. There is a walkway round it enclosed by compact bushes cut into various shapes; close by there is a circular drive which encloses box in different shapes, and shrubs kept low by being cut back. The whole area is protected by a wall which is hidden from view by a tiered hedge of box. Outside the wall there is a meadow; nature has made it as much worth seeing as the garden just described, which was devised by human skill. Beyond it there are fields and many other meadows and plantations.

At the head of the colonnade a dining room juts out. Through its folding doors it surveys the end of the terrace and immediately beyond it the meadow and the expanse of countryside. From the windows on one side it looks out onto the side of the terrace and onto a projecting part of the house, and on the other the grove and its foliage, which lie within the exercise-ground for horses close by. Virtually opposite the middle of the colonnade there is a suite of rooms somewhat set back; it encircles a courtyard shaded by four plane trees. They surround a fountain in a marble basin, which gushes forth and refreshes the plane trees round it and the earth beneath them with its gentle spray. This suite of rooms contains a bedroom which shuts out the daylight, shouting, and other sounds, and adjoining it is a dining room for everyday use by me and my friends. It looks out on the courtyard which I mentioned, on one wing of the colonnade, and on the general vista which the colonnade enjoys. There is also a second bedroom which the nearest plane tree endows with greenery and shade. It is adorned with marble up to the dado, and has a mural depicting tree-branches with birds perched upon them, a scene no less charming than the marble. In this bedroom there is a small fountain enclosed by a basin, the several jets around which combine to make a most pleasing whisper.

At the corner of the colonnade, the largest bedroom faces the dining room. From one set of windows it looks down on the terrace, from the other on the meadow, in front of which there is an ornamental pool lying below the windows and enhancing the view from them, for it is pleasant both to the ear and to the eye, because the water cascades down from a height and turns white when it enters the marble basin. This room is beautifully warm in winter, for it is constantly bathed in sunshine. Adjacent to it is the hot-air room, and if the day is cloudy the steam is injected and takes over the role of the sun.



The spacious and cheerful room next to it, in which one disrobes for bathing, is adjoined by the cooling-room, in which there is a good-sized swimming-pool shaded from the sun. If you want a bigger or warmer pool to swim in, there is one in the courtyard with a well next to it, from which you can freshen up again if the warm water is cloying. The cooling-room leads into a middle room, in which the sun provides a most genial service, though this is more in evidence in the hot room, for it projects outwards. This has three plunge-baths, two in the sun and the third at some distance from it, though not from its light. Beyond the disrobing-room a ball-court has been erected, big enough to cater for several kinds of exercise and for several circles of players.
